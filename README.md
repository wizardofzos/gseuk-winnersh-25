# Demo Material

As presented at GSE UK Securoty Workgroup Meeting on Feb 27 2025

## How to use

    git clone git@github.com:wizardofzos/gseuk-winnersh-25.git
    cd gseuk-winnersh-25
    python3 -m venv .
    . bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Then start `jupyter-notebook` and a browser will open where you can
run the demos.

Obvisouly you'll need to provide your own datafiles. 

See https://mfpandas.readthedocs.io on how to get the correct data from your z/OS system.

Happy MFPanda-ing!
